project:
  wokwi_id:    358370685977079809        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Enno Schnackenberg"      # Your name
  title:        "Microtapeout"      # Project title
  language:     "WOKWI"      # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "A Shift Register, A seven segment encoder (Hex), 1 Bit ALU, 3 Bit Adder"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      You can select the project over Input 0 and 1 (e.g. 01 for the seven segment encoder) and then have the 6 remaining pins for the project

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set Input 1 to HIGH and then e.g. use Inputs 3 - 6 for the number input (MSB first)
